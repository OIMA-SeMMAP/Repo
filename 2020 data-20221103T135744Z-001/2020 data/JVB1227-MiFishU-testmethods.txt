Sample Process
1.4.1
A High Quality 40W USB CO2 Laser Engraving Cutting Machine Engraver Cutter with CorelDraw Software (cat# DKJ-40W-US) (Amunstar Trading Company, Guangdong, China) was used for removal of plastic casing from filter. Once plastic casing was cut, sample barcodes were recorded and assigned a well within the 96 well plate or numbered extraction tube. The whole filter was removed and transferred to the extraction plate/tube using sterilized tweezers inside a laminar flow hood. Plates or tubes were immediately processed or stored in -20C until the extraction process could be performed.


Extraction
2.1.2
Genomic DNA from samples was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 Kit (Cat # 12955-4) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genomic DNA was eluted into 100µl and frozen at -20C.


PCR
3.18.3
Forward Primer: GTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC

Reverse Primer: CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG

Primer notes: 

Primer reference: Miya et al 2015

Portions of hyper-variable regions of the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were PCR amplified from each genomic DNA sample using the MiFishUF and MiFishUR primers with spacer regions. Both forward and reverse primers also contained a 5’ adaptor sequence to allow for subsequent indexing and Illumina sequencing. PCR amplification was performed in replicates of six and all six replicates were not pooled and kept separate. Each 25 µL PCR reaction was mixed according to the Promega PCR Master Mix specifications (Promega catalog # M5133, Madison, WI) which included 12.5ul Master Mix, 0.5 µM of each primer, 1.0 µl of gDNA, and 10.5 µl DNase/RNase-free H2O. DNA was PCR amplified using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95C for 3 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 20 seconds at 98C, 30 seconds at 60C, and 30 seconds at 72C, and a final elongation at 72C for 10 minutes. Added 11/2019.


Gel
4.1.1
To determine amplicon size and PCR efficiency, each reaction was visually inspected using a 2% agarose gel with 5µl of each sample as input. 


PCR Amplicon Cleanup
5.1.1
Amplicons were then cleaned by incubating amplicons with Exo1/SAP for 30 minutes at 37C following by inactivation at 95C for 5 minutes and stored at -20C. 


Barcoding PCR
6.1.1
A second round of PCR was performed to give each sample a unique 12-nucleotide index sequence. The indexing PCR included Promega Master mix, 0.5 µM of each primer and 2 µl of template DNA (cleaned amplicon from the first PCR reaction) and consisted of an initial denaturation of 95C for 3 minutes followed by 8 cycles of  95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 seconds and 72C for 30 seconds. 


PCR Normal Pool
8.1.1
Final indexed amplicons from each sample were cleaned and normalized using SequalPrep Normalization Plates (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). 25µl of PCR amplicon is purified and normalize using the Life Technologies SequalPrep Normalization kit (cat#A10510-01) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples are then pooled together by adding 5µl of each normalized sample to the pool.  


Sequencing
9.2.1
Sample library pools were sent for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq (San Diego, CA) in the CU Boulder BioFrontiers Sequencing Center using the v2 500-cycle kit (cat# MS-102-2003). Necessary quality control measures were performed at the sequencing center prior to sequencing.


Bioinformatics
10.11.1
Sequences were processed with the JAMP pipeline (https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP). Demultiplexing of raw data was done with "iu-demultiplex" v2.3 (https://github.com/merenlab/illumina-utils). Forward and reverse reads from each sample where paired end merged with Usearch v11.0.667 [1]. Primers where trimmed from both sides, and reads of 130 – 210 bp length retained using Cutadapt v1.18 [2]. Quality filtering was carried out using expected error filtering (max_ee=0.5) as implemented in Usearch [3]. Instead of OTU clustering, reads affected by sequencing and PCR errors are then removed using the unoise3 algorithm with an alpha value of 5 [4]. This denoising is applied to each individual sample, and Exact sequence variants (ESV) complied in a ESV table including sequences and read counts for each sample. Taxonomy is assigned to each ESV by mapping them against a MitoFish database containing complete + partial mtDNA reference data, using usearch_global with –maxaccepts 0 and –maxrejects 0 to ensure mapping accuracy. Consensus taxonomy is generated from the hit tables, by first considering 100% matches, and then going down in 1% steps until hits are present for each ESV. In the respective 1% bracket, taxonomy present in at least 90% of the hits is reported or an NA reported, if several taxa are matching the ESV. To reduce errors caused by misidentified taxa, the bracket is increased to 2% if matches of 97% or higher are present, and no family level taxonomy is returned.
